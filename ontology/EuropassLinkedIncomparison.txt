Crowd Work CV ontology is compliant with existing standard traditional CV information. 

Taking Europass as the most representative case, the work experience is reported indicating *when* it took place, the *employer*, the *place*, the *position* held, and the *responsibilities*. Similarly, in a Crowd Work CV we reflect the time period when the work took place, indicate the requester who published the microtask and specify the marketplace where the microtasks were accomplished. At the moment the data model does not include a mapping to position and responsibilities because the microtask crowdsourcing workflow does not support it, but it could be interesting as a future extension. For the education, Europass requires the *time period*, the *title*, the *organisation* who provided it, a *description*, related *subjects* (e.\,g.\ skills) and the educational field. We group these via the relation between the qualification and the microtask, connect the qualification with a Disco-Esco competence (European Dictionary of Skills and Competences (DISCO \http://disco-tools.eu/disco2_portal/) and indicate a description. 

Analogously LinkedIn and hResume are covered given the fact that they also structure the information as personal profile, experience, education, and skills. Regarding LinkedIn, what becomes interesting is that it could be possible to report the crowd work specified by the Crowd Work CV in LinkedIn.
